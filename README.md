# Data Science Notebooks

## Repo Purpose

This repo holds a variety of guided data science projects I performed while taking part in DataQuest's (dataquest.io) Data Analyst
and Data Scientist paths. They range from data-set analysis and visualization using Numpy and Matplotlib, through machine 
learning and making stock market and game review predictions using sckikit-learn.
